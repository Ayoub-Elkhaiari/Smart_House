# Smart House Prototype Controlled Via Java Based Application

## Overview
Welcome to the Smart House Prototype, an innovative bachelor's graduate project that demonstrates the future of home automation! This system showcases how to control a house using voice commands, leveraging embedded machine learning technology.

## Project Description
This project is a proof-of-concept for a smart home system that includes:
- Voice-controlled home automation
- A Java-based mobile application interface
- Embedded machine learning for command interpretation
- Customizable voice commands
- Real-time status updates of connected devices

## Features
- **Voice Control**: Simulated control of house functions using natural language voice instructions.
- **Mobile Application Source Code**: A Java-based mobile app for user interaction.
- **Customizable Commands**: Framework for personalizing the system with unique voice commands.
- **Real-time Updates**: System for providing instant status updates of the Smart House.
- **Embedded Machine Learning**: Implementation of AI for voice recognition and command execution.


## Technical Stack
- Java (Android app development)
- Python (Machine Learning models)
- TensorFlow(in case you implemented your speech recognition and convert it to tensorflow lite)
- Arduino
- Android Studio
- Git for version control

## Setup for Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ayoub-Elkhaiari/Smart_House.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies (list them here or refer to a requirements.txt file)
3. Set up the development environment (e.g., Android Studio for the mobile app)

## Usage
This project is a prototype and not intended for real-world deployment. However, you can:
1. Study the source code to understand the implementation of voice recognition and smart home control.
2. Run the mobile app in an Android emulator to see the user interface.
3. Test the speech recognition.

## Future Work
- Integration with actual smart home devices
- Improvement of the machine learning model's accuracy
- Expansion of the voice command vocabulary
- Development of a cloud-based backend for remote access

## Academic Context
This Smart House Prototype was developed as a bachelor's graduate project at Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah. It demonstrates the application of machine learning, mobile development, and IoT concepts in creating a smart home solution.
